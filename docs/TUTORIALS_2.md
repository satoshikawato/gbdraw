## Customizing Your Plot

**Goal**: Learn the basics of customizing plot appearance, including colors, labels, and output files. We'll build on the plot from the Quickstart.

### 1. Changing the Color Scheme
gbdraw comes with 55 built-in color palettes. You can change the palette using the 

-p or --palette option. Let's try the `ajisai` palette:
```bash
```

Notice we also used the `-o` option to set a new output name.

### 2. Adjusting Labels
gbdraw provides powerful control over which feature labels are displayed. While advanced control is covered in the Reference and Explanation sections, you can adjust the font size for all labels with --font-size.

### 3. Adding a Title
You can add a main title to your plot using the --title argument.
