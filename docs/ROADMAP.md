# Roadmap

## Recently Implemented

- Automatic adjustment of GC content/skew windows and steps based on genome size
- Legend placement adjustment (multiple positions available)
- Overlap resolution for features (`--resolve_overlaps`)
- Scale interval customization (`--scale_interval`)
- Legend size customization (`--legend_box_size`, `--legend_font_size`)
- GC skew track for linear mode (`--show_skew`)
- Scale style options for linear mode (`--scale_style bar/ruler`)
- Feature/GC/comparison height customization for linear mode

## Planned Features

### Short-term
- Tick label configuration (custom units/formatting, e.g., per Mb)
- `--separate_strands` by default (change in args)
- Feature-wise SVG element grouping (group by feature/track for easier editing)

### Long-term
- PAF/MAF support (pairwise matches)
- Feature overlap resolution with label overlap handling (overlapping genes, transcript isoforms, etc.)
- Custom tracks (read depth, motifs, etc.)
