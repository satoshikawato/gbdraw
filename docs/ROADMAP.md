# Roadmap

## Planned features
### Short-term plans
- Automatic adjustment of GC content/skew windows and steps (10kb window-1kb step for genomes larger than 1Mb; window size makes a huge difference in PNG/PDF processing time!)
- Tick label configuration (e.g. per Mb)
- `--separate_strands` by default (change in args)
- Legend placement adjustment
- Feature-wise SVG element grouping (for the ease of manual editing)
### Long-term plans
- PAF/MAF support (pairwise matches) 
- Feature overlap resolution (overlapping genes, transcript isoforms etc.;unsure how to impelment mutiple tracks with label overlap resolution)
- Custom tracks (read depth, motifs, etc.)
