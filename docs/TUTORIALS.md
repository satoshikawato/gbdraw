## Quickstart: Your First Plot in 5 Minutes

**Goal**: This tutorial will guide you from installation to generating your first circular genome plot.

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have gbdraw installed locally using either the Bioconda or Build from Source method described on the Installation page.
```bash

```
### 2. Get Sample Data
We will use a sample GenBank file for this tutorial. Download it using the following command:
```bash

```
### 3. Generate the Plot
Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the file and run the following command:
```bash

```
This tells gbdraw to create a circular plot using the GenBank file sample.gbk as input.
```bash

```
### 4. Check Your Output
You will see a new file named gbdraw_out.svg in your directory. Open it in a web browser or vector graphics editor (like Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator) to see your first genome map!
```bash

```
### 5. Next Steps
Congratulations! You've created your first plot.
```bash

```
