## Note
This package was inspired by a variety of existing programs and tools in the bioinformatics field. The development of gbdraw was guided by the features and capabilities of these tools, and we acknowledge their influence in shaping our approach to genome visualization and analysis:

[CGView](https://cgview.ca/)

[ACT](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/tool/artemis-comparison-tool-act/)

[SnapGene Viewer](https://www.snapgene.com/snapgene-viewer)

[DNA Features Viewer](https://github.com/Edinburgh-Genome-Foundry/DnaFeaturesViewer)

[pyGenomeViz](https://github.com/moshi4/pyGenomeViz)

[Circos](https://www.circos.ca/)

[GenomeMatcher](https://www.ige.tohoku.ac.jp/joho/gmProject/gmhomeJP.html)

[GenomeDiagram](https://biopython-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/17%20-%20Graphics%20including%20GenomeDiagram.html)

[GenoVi](https://github.com/robotoD/GenoVi)

[OrganellarGenomeDRAW (OGDRAW)](https://chlorobox.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/OGDraw.html)

The core functionality of gbdraw has evolved from [a set of Python scripts](https://github.com/satoshikawato/bio_small_scripts/) written back in 2022. Key among these are:

[plot_circular_genome.py](https://github.com/satoshikawato/bio_small_scripts/blob/main/plot_circular_genome.py)

[plot_linear_genome.py](https://github.com/satoshikawato/bio_small_scripts/blob/main/plot_linear_genome.py)
